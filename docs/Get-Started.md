# Getting Started

GrandCypher is a Python implementation of the [Cypher](#) graph query language. It enables you to easily convert queries written for Neo4j into queries for NetworkX graphs. In fact, with [Grand](https://github.com/aplbrain/grand), this tool also enables you to query other graph libraries like Networkit or IGraph.
